Supplementary Maven plugin for Jcabi Parent POM

  It is used in {{{../parent/index.html}<<<com.jcabi:parent>>>}}
  POM project in order to automate certain build operations.

  You can use it directly, as explained in the examples:

   * {{{./example-ajc.html}<<<ajc>>>}}:
     weaves <<<.class>>> files with AspectJ aspects available in
     classpath (binary weaving).

   * {{{./example-versionalize.html}<<<versionalize>>>}}:
     adds plain text files with version information to every Java
     package in your source directory.

  Starting from the version <<<0.10>>> there are two parameters
  you may setup to select the version of your Java code :

   * source

   * target

  If you don't setup them, it is assumed that your code is compatible
  with Java <<<1.6>>>.
  For Java 8 configuration look the example {{{./example-java8.html}<<<java8>>>}}.

* Cutting Edge Version

  If you want to use current version of the product, you can do it with
  this configuration in your <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <id>oss.sonatype.org</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
      <artifactId>jcabi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      [...]
      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
          <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
          <version>5.0.0.Final</version>
          <scope>runtime</scope>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
+--

  Note: jcabi-maven-plugin has to have hibernate-validator dependency as in
  the example to avoid "JSR-303 validator failed to initialize: Unable to instantiate
  Configuration" warning during build.
